## Test 1: Application Startup

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Mock data file (`data/mockData.ts`) has been completely removed
- ✅ Patient store starts with empty array instead of mock patients
- ✅ Antenatal visit store starts with empty array instead of mock visits
- ✅ `initializeWithMockData()` function has been removed

## Test 2: Store Initialization

- ✅ Patient store `loadPatients()` function initializes with empty array when no AsyncStorage data exists
- ✅ Antenatal visit store `loadVisits()` function initializes with empty array when no AsyncStorage data exists
- ✅ No fallback to mock data in error scenarios

## Test 3: Dashboard Components

- ✅ Dashboard utilities handle empty arrays safely with proper null checks
- ✅ `getTodaysVisits()` returns empty array when no visits exist
- ✅ `calculateDashboardStats()` returns zero values when no data exists
- ✅ TodaysVisitsSection has proper empty state UI with helpful message
- ✅ SummaryStatsSection displays zero values correctly

## Test 4: Data Creation Functionality

- ✅ All CRUD operations in patient store remain intact
- ✅ All CRUD operations in antenatal visit store remain intact
- ✅ Form persistence and creation workflows are unaffected
- ✅ Risk assessment functionality continues to work

## Test 5: Empty State UI

- ✅ Dashboard shows appropriate empty states
- ✅ Statistics display zeros properly
- ✅ Empty visit lists show helpful guidance messages
- ✅ No broken references to mock data

## Summary

All mock data has been successfully removed from the HiMom application. The app now starts with a clean slate while maintaining all functionality for creating and managing real patient data. Users can now create their own proper patient records without being confused by fake data.

The application is ready for production use with proper empty state handling and all creation workflows intact.
